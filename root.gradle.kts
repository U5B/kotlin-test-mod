  // This should form a directed graph with no cycles (i.e. a tree), which the preprocessor will then traverse to
  // produce source code for all versions from the main version.
  // Do note that the preprocessor can only convert between two projects when they are either on the same Minecraft
  // version (but use different mappings, e.g. 1.16.2 forge to fabric), or when they are using the same intermediary
  // mappings (but on different Minecraft versions, e.g. 1.12.2 forge to 1.8.9 forge, or 1.16.2 fabric to 1.18 fabric)
  // but not both at the same time, i.e. you cannot go straight from 1.12.2 forge to 1.16.2 fabric, you need to go via
  // an intermediary 1.16.2 forge project which has something in common with both.

  // itself, e.g. forge intermediary names do not contain class names, so you may need to supply mappings for those
  // manually.
